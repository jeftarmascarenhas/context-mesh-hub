# Project Intent: Weather App Minimal

## What

Build a simple, modern Weather application that allows users to:
- Search for weather information by city name
- Display current weather conditions (temperature, description, icon)
- Show weather data in a clean, modern UI using shadcn-ui components

## Why

**Business Value**:
- Learn Context Mesh framework with a practical, minimal project
- Demonstrate AI-First development workflow in a simple context
- Create a quick-start example for developers new to Context Mesh
- Show how context drives code generation effectively

**Technical Value**:
- Practice full-stack development with modern tools (Vite, Fastify, shadcn-ui)
- Implement clean architecture patterns
- Show Context Mesh workflow (Intent → Build → Learn) in action
- Demonstrate API integration with external services

## Scope

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Phase 1
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn-ui
- Backend: Node.js + Fastify + Swagger
- Weather API integration: Open-Meteo (free, no API key)
- Search weather by city name
- Display current weather (temperature, description, icon)
- Simple, clean UI with loading and error states

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Weather forecast (multi-day)
- Location-based weather (geolocation)
- Weather history
- Multiple cities saved
- Weather maps
- Database persistence
- Authentication
- Testing (optional for minimal example)
- CI/CD (optional for minimal example)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] Users can search for weather by city name
- [ ] Weather information displays correctly (temperature, description, icon)
- [ ] Loading state shows while fetching data
- [ ] Error state shows if city not found or API fails
- [ ] UI is clean and responsive
- [ ] Swagger documentation is accessible

### Non-Functional
- [ ] Application loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 1 second
- [ ] Clean, modern UI using shadcn-ui components
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Backend API is documented with Swagger
- [ ] Code structure is simple but organized

## Constraints

- **Time**: 45-60 minutes for complete implementation
- **Team**: 1 developer (solo project)
- **Budget**: Free tier services only (Open-Meteo is free and open source)
- **Technology**: Must use TypeScript, Vite, Fastify, shadcn-ui
- **Complexity**: Minimal - only happy path, no edge cases or bugs
