# Learning: Authentication Implementation Insights

## Insight

During the authentication implementation, we discovered that storing JWT tokens in localStorage is less secure than using httpOnly cookies, especially for production applications.

## What Happened

**Initial Implementation**:
- Used localStorage to store JWT tokens
- Tokens accessible via JavaScript (XSS vulnerability)
- Simple implementation for MVP

**Discovery**:
- Security review identified XSS risk
- Research showed httpOnly cookies are more secure
- Decided to refactor before production

## Impact

**Security**:
- ✅ httpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ Tokens not accessible via JavaScript
- ⚠️ Requires CSRF protection (future enhancement)

**Development**:
- ✅ Refactoring was straightforward
- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Better security posture

## Action

1. **Immediate**: Refactored to use httpOnly cookies
2. **Future**: Add CSRF protection
3. **Documentation**: Updated decision record with outcomes
