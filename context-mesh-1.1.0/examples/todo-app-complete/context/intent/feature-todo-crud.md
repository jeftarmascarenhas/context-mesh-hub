# Intent: Feature - Todo CRUD Operations

## What

Implement complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items:
- Create new todos with title, description, category
- Read/list all user's todos
- Update existing todos (title, description, status, category)
- Delete todos
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete

## Why

- [ ] User can update todo properties (title, description, status, category)
- [ ] User can delete a todo
- [ ] User can mark todo as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Todos are filtered by authenticated user (security)
- [ ] API validates input data

## Technical Approach

- **Backend**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: Todos table with user_id foreign key
