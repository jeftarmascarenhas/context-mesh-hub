# Feature Intent: Testing Implementation

## What

Implement comprehensive unit testing for both backend API and frontend React components to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and enable confident refactoring.

## Why

**Business Value**:
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Enable safe refactoring
- Reduce maintenance costs
- Meet project acceptance criteria (70% code coverage)

**Technical Value**:
- Validate code quality automatically
- Enable CI/CD pipeline validation
- Document expected behavior through tests
- Improve code design (testable code is better code)

## Scope

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for API routes (auth, todos)
- Unit tests for services (auth.service, todo.service)
- Unit tests for middleware (auth.middleware, error.middleware)
- Unit tests for DTOs and validation
- Mock Prisma client for database operations
- Test coverage: Minimum 70%

### Frontend Testing
- Unit tests for React components (Login, Signup, TodoList, TodoItem, etc.)
- Unit tests for custom hooks (if any)
- Unit tests for API service integration
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- Test coverage: Minimum 70%

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Integration tests (API + Database)
- End-to-end tests (E2E with Playwright/Cypress)
- Visual regression tests
- Performance tests

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] All API routes have unit tests
- [ ] All services have unit tests
- [ ] All middleware have unit tests
- [ ] All React components have unit tests
- [ ] All custom hooks have unit tests (if any)
- [ ] Tests run successfully with `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage meets 70% minimum

### Non-Functional
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Tests are fast (< 30 seconds total)
- [ ] Tests are reliable (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Tests are maintainable (clear, well-organized)
- [ ] Tests document expected behavior

## Implementation Approach

1. **Setup Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Configure Jest for backend
   - Configure Jest + React Testing Library for frontend
   - Set up coverage reporting
   - Add test scripts to package.json

2. **Write Tests**:
   - Start with critical paths (auth, CRUD operations)
   - Test happy paths first
   - Add edge cases and error handling
   - Ensure 70% coverage minimum

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Run tests in GitHub Actions
   - Fail build if tests fail
   - Fail build if coverage below threshold
   - Generate coverage reports

## Constraints

- **Time**: Implement alongside feature development
- **Coverage**: Minimum 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library (as per decisions)
- **Performance**: Tests must run quickly (< 30 seconds)
