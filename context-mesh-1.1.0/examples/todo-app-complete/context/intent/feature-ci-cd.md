# Feature Intent: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## What

Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically tests, builds, and deploys the application to Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) on every push to the main branch.

## Why

**Business Value**:
- Faster delivery cycles
- Reduced manual deployment work
- Catch issues before production
- Consistent deployment process

**Technical Value**:
- Automated quality checks
- Automated testing
- Automated deployment
- Clear build status visibility
- Rollback capability

## Scope

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Run linter on every push and PR
- Run tests on every push and PR
- Check code coverage on every push and PR
- Build application on every push and PR
- Show build status in GitHub PRs
- Fail build if tests fail or coverage below threshold

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Deploy backend to Railway on push to `main` (after CI passes)
- Deploy frontend to Vercel on push to `main` (after CI passes)
- Only deploy if CI passes
- Only deploy from `main` branch
- Support preview deployments for PRs (Vercel)

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Staging environment
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary deployments
- Automated rollback on errors
- Performance testing in CI

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] CI runs on every push and PR
- [ ] Tests run automatically in CI
- [ ] Linter runs automatically in CI
- [ ] Coverage check runs automatically in CI
- [ ] Backend deploys to Railway automatically (on main)
- [ ] Frontend deploys to Vercel automatically (on main)
- [ ] Build status visible in GitHub PRs
- [ ] Failed builds prevent deployment

### Non-Functional
- [ ] CI completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Deployment completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Clear error messages on failure
- [ ] Secrets properly secured
- [ ] Workflows are maintainable

## Implementation Approach

1. **Setup GitHub Actions**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/backend.yml`
   - Create `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`
   - Configure triggers (push, PR)
   - Set up Node.js environment

2. **Configure CI Steps**:
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Node.js
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linter
   - Run tests with coverage
   - Build application

3. **Configure CD Steps**:
   - Deploy to Railway (backend)
   - Deploy to Vercel (frontend)
   - Set up secrets in GitHub
   - Configure environment variables

4. **Test Locally**:
   - Use `act` to test workflows locally
   - Validate workflow syntax
   - Test basic functionality

## Constraints

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- **Backend**: Railway (free tier)
- **Frontend**: Vercel (free tier)
- **Time**: Setup alongside development
- **Security**: Secrets must be properly managed
