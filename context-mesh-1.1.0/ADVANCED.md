# Context Mesh - Advanced Patterns

> 📚 **Deep Dive** - This is optional reading. You can use Context Mesh without reading this.
> Start with [README.md](README.md) and [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

---

This document covers advanced patterns and extensions for Context Mesh. These patterns are **optional** and can be adopted as your project grows or when you need more structure.

## Overview

While Context Mesh works perfectly with just the basic 3-step workflow (Intent, Build, Learn), advanced patterns can help with:
- Larger projects with multiple features
- Team collaboration
- Complex build processes
- Reusable execution patterns
- Better organization and scalability

**Important**: These patterns are **extensions**, not requirements. Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

---

## AGENTS.md Integration

**[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)** is an open format used by over 20,000 open-source projects. It works seamlessly with Context Mesh as a **router** that uses Context Mesh as the central knowledge hub.

### How AGENTS.md Works with Context Mesh

**AGENTS.md** provides operational instructions (setup, commands, conventions) and **routes** AI agents to Context Mesh files for strategic context (intent, decisions, knowledge).

**Structure**:
```
project/
├── AGENTS.md          # Router: operational instructions + Context Mesh references
└── context/           # Context Mesh: strategic context
    ├── intent/
    ├── decisions/
    ├── knowledge/
    └── agents/        # Optional: specialized agent definitions (agent-*.md)
        └── agent-*.md
```

**AGENTS.md** should include a section like:
```markdown
## Context Files to Load

When working on this project, AI agents should load:

- @context/intent/project-intent.md
- @context/decisions/001-tech-stack.md
- @context/knowledge/patterns/*.md
```

See [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) for complete AGENTS.md integration guide.

**Note**: AGENTS.md is **optional** but **recommended**. It enhances AI agent experience by providing operational guidance while Context Mesh provides strategic context.

---

## AI Agents Structure (agent-*.md)

### What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are structured definitions that specify how AI should execute specific parts of the Build phase. They complement the Context Mesh by providing **execution patterns** alongside the **context** (intent, decisions, patterns).

**Relationship**:
- **Context Mesh** = What and why (intent, decisions, knowledge)
- **AI Agents** = How to execute (build automation, execution patterns)

### When to Use AI Agents

**Use AI Agents (agent-*.md) when**:
- ✅ You have complex build processes
- ✅ You want to modularize execution
- ✅ You need reusable execution patterns
- ✅ You're working with a team
- ✅ You want to execute specific parts of the build
- ✅ You find yourself writing detailed prompts repeatedly

**Don't use AI Agents when**:
- ❌ Your project is simple (use simple prompts instead)
- ❌ You're just starting (start with simple prompts)
- ❌ You prefer ad-hoc execution
- ❌ Context alone is sufficient (simple prompts work)

### AI Agents vs Simple Prompts vs Detailed Prompts

**Hierarchy of Approaches**:

1. **✅ Simple Prompts** (Recommended - Default)
   - Use when: Context is sufficient
   - Example: `"Implement authentication following @context/intent/feature-user-auth.md"`
   - Start here for all projects

2. **✅ AI Agents (agent-*.md)** (Advanced - When Needed)
   - Use when: Need structured/reusable execution, teams, complex projects
   - Example: `"Execute @agents/agent-backend.md for payment feature"`
   - Add when simple prompts aren't enough

3. **⚠️ Detailed Prompts** (Avoid - Temporary Only)
   - Use when: Testing, temporary override, learning
   - Not recommended: Duplicates context, hard to maintain
   - If needed frequently, create an agent file instead

**Decision Guide**:
- **Simple project, single feature** → Use **Simple Prompts**
- **Complex project, multiple features** → Use **AI Agents**
- **Team collaboration** → Use **AI Agents**
- **Temporary test** → **Detailed Prompt** (acceptable, but temporary)
- **Learning** → Start with **Simple Prompts**

**Key Principle**: If you're writing detailed prompts repeatedly, create an `agent-*.md` file instead. This makes the pattern reusable and structured.

### Structure

Create an `agents/` directory inside your `context/` directory:

```
project/
├── AGENTS.md          # Router: operational instructions + Context Mesh references
└── context/           # Context Mesh (what and why)
    ├── intent/
    ├── decisions/
    ├── knowledge/
    └── agents/        # Specialized AI Agents (how to execute specific parts)
        ├── agent-planner.md
        ├── agent-developer.md
        ├── agent-reviewer.md
        ├── agent-devops.md
        └── agent-insights.md
```

**Relationship**:
- **AGENTS.md** = Router that references Context Mesh (operational + routing)
- **agent-*.md** = Specialized execution patterns (modular workflows)
- **Context Mesh** = Strategic context (intent, decisions, knowledge)

### Agent File Format

Each agent file follows this structure. You can use a **simple format** for basic agents or a **detailed format** for specialized agents:

#### Simple Format (Basic Agents)

```markdown
# Agent: [Agent Name]

## Purpose
[What this agent does]

## Responsibilities
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

## Context Files to Load
- @context/intent/[relevant-intent].md
- @context/decisions/[relevant-decision].md
- @context/knowledge/patterns/[relevant-pattern].md

## Execution Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Scope
- [What this agent can do]
- [What this agent cannot do]

## Outputs
- [Output 1]
- [Output 2]

## Related
- Intent: [related-intent].md
- Decision: [related-decision].md
- Other Agents: [related-agents].md
```

#### Detailed Format (Specialized Agents)

For specialized agents (backend, frontend, database, etc.), use a more detailed format:

```markdown
# Agent: [Agent Name] — [Specialization]

## Scope
- **Allowed directories:** [specific paths]
- **Must read:** [required context files]
- **Prohibited:** [what this agent cannot change]

## Responsibilities
- [Specific technical responsibility 1]
- [Specific technical responsibility 2]
- [Specific technical responsibility 3]

## Conventions
- [Code convention 1]
- [Code convention 2]
- [Architecture pattern to follow]

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [DoD criterion 1]
- [DoD criterion 2]
- [DoD criterion 3]

## Example Tasks
- "Task example 1"
- "Task example 2"

## References
- @context/decisions/[relevant-decision].md
- @context/knowledge/patterns/[relevant-pattern].md
- [Other relevant files]
```

**Choose the format based on your needs:**
- **Simple format**: For general-purpose agents (Planner, Developer, Reviewer) or when starting out
- **Detailed format**: For specialized agents (Backend, Frontend, Database, specific features) or when you need strict boundaries and conventions

**Key differences:**
- **Simple format**: Flexible, general-purpose, good for learning
- **Detailed format**: Strict scope, technical conventions, DoD, better for production teams

**Note on DoD in Agents**: DoD in agent definitions applies to **Step 2 (Build)** when agents are executing technical implementation. Agents used in Step 1 (Intent) or Step 3 (Learn) don't need DoD - they have flexible "Outputs" instead, as those steps are more iterative and adaptive.

## Using AI Agents

### Basic Workflow

1. **Step 1 (Intent)**: Use `agent-planner.md` to help structure intent
2. **Step 2 (Build)**: Use `agent-developer.md` to generate code, `agent-reviewer.md` to review
3. **Step 3 (Learn)**: Use `agent-devops.md` to deploy, `agent-insights.md` to learn

### Execution Patterns

**Pattern 1: Complete Build**
```
1. Load: @context/agents/agent-developer.md
2. Load: @context/intent/feature-*.md
3. Load: @context/decisions/*.md
4. Execute: "Generate the feature following the Developer agent instructions"
```

**Pattern 2: Modular Execution with Specialized Agents**
```
1. Load: @context/agents/agent-backend.md (specialized agent)
2. Load: @context/intent/feature-*.md
3. Load: @context/decisions/002-database.md
4. Execute: "Generate the backend API following agent-backend.md instructions"
5. Then: Load @context/agents/agent-reviewer.md and review
```

**Pattern 2b: Feature-Specific Agent**
```
1. Load: @context/agents/agent-payment.md (feature-specific agent)
2. Load: @context/intent/feature-payment.md
3. Execute: "Implement payment feature following agent-payment.md"
```

**Pattern 3: Full Workflow**
```
1. Intent: Use agent-planner.md
2. Build: Use agent-developer.md + agent-reviewer.md
3. Learn: Use agent-devops.md + agent-insights.md
```

### Custom Agents

You can create custom agents for specific needs. Here are examples of specialized agents:

#### Example 1: Backend Specialist (Detailed Format)

**Example**: `context/agents/agent-backend.md`
```markdown
# Agent: Backend Specialist (NestJS + Prisma)

## Scope
- **Allowed directories:** `/apps/api/src/**`, `/apps/api/prisma/**`
- **Must read:** `AGENTS.md`, `context/decisions/001-tech-stack.md`, `context/decisions/002-database.md`, `context/intent/project-intent.md`
- **Prohibited:** Changes to `package.json` at root, Docker files, or repo structure **without explicit instruction**.

## Responsibilities
- Scaffold NestJS modules: `controller`, `service`, `dto` (no business logic in controllers)
- Implement Prisma models & **migrations**; update **seeds** when applicable
- Add **Swagger** decorators and tag routes by module
- Enforce **tenant scoping** on all queries (see decision 002-database.md)
- Implement **Auth** per decision 005-auth.md (GitHub OAuth + Email/Password; JWT guards)
- Integrate **BullMQ stubs** for Orchestrator/Observer registration (runtime module)

## Conventions
- Place modules under: `apps/api/src/modules/<feature>/`
- DTOs go in `dto/` with `class-validator` + `class-transformer`
- Export services via module providers; **avoid** cross-service direct imports
- Use **PrismaService** via DI; no raw SQL unless justified in comments
- Add **unit tests (Jest)** under `__tests__/` in each module

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- Prisma model + migration applied
- DTOs with validation + Swagger documented
- Service with business logic; controller thin
- Unit tests passing; lints passing
- Tenant filters in queries; no secrets logged
- Endpoints appear in Swagger `/api/docs`

## Example Tasks
- "Add CRUD for **Network** (decision 002-database.md), including unique `(tenantId, chainId)` constraint"
- "Implement **Auth** module per decision 005-auth.md with JWT guard + `@CurrentUser()` decorator"
- "Create **Contract** module: store ABI JSONB and validate functions on create"

## Adapting Existing Agents to Context Mesh

If you already have agents defined (like the NestJS + Prisma example) or use AGENTS.md, adapt them to Context Mesh:

### AGENTS.md Integration

**AGENTS.md** works as a router that references Context Mesh files. Update your `AGENTS.md` to reference Context Mesh:

**Before (Without Context Mesh)**:
```markdown
## Must read: `AGENTS.md`, ADR-000..ADR-005, `MVP_OVERVIEW.md`
```

**After (With Context Mesh)**:
```markdown
## Context Files to Load

When working on this project, AI agents should load:

- @context/intent/project-intent.md (overall project goals)
- @context/decisions/001-tech-stack.md (was ADR-000)
- @context/decisions/002-database.md (was ADR-002)
- @context/decisions/005-auth.md (was ADR-005)
- @context/knowledge/patterns/nestjs-module-pattern.md
```

### Agent Files (agent-*.md) Integration

**Before (Without Context Mesh)**:
```markdown
## Must read: `AGENTS.md`, ADR-000..ADR-005, `MVP_OVERVIEW.md`
```

**After (With Context Mesh)**:
```markdown
## Must read: 
- @context/intent/project-intent.md
- @context/decisions/001-tech-stack.md (was ADR-000)
- @context/decisions/002-database.md (was ADR-002)
- @context/decisions/005-auth.md (was ADR-005)
- @context/knowledge/patterns/nestjs-module-pattern.md
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Update AGENTS.md**: Add "Context Files to Load" section referencing Context Mesh files
2. **Map ADRs to Decisions**: Convert `ADR-XXX` references to `context/decisions/XXX-*.md`
3. **Map Overview to Intent**: Convert `MVP_OVERVIEW.md` to `context/intent/project-intent.md`
4. **Add Pattern References**: Link to `context/knowledge/patterns/` when applicable
5. **Update Agent Files**: Update `context/agents/agent-*.md` files to reference Context Mesh
6. **Update References Section**: Use Context Mesh file references (`@context/...`)

### Benefits of Migration
- ✅ Better organization (all context in one place)
- ✅ Full traceability (intent → decisions → code)
- ✅ Living context (updates with learnings)
- ✅ Framework consistency

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Don't create agents until you need them
- Start with basic Context Mesh
- Add agents when complexity grows
- Use simple format first, detailed format when needed

### 2. Keep Agents Focused
- Each agent should have a clear, single purpose
- Don't mix responsibilities
- Keep scope well-defined
- Use detailed format for strict boundaries

### 3. Link to Context
- Always link agents to relevant context files
- Use `@context/...` references
- Update context when agents execute
- Maintain traceability

### 4. Document Execution
- Document how to use each agent
- Include example tasks
- Keep agents updated
- Add DoD for specialized agents

### 5. Reuse and Share
- Reuse agents across projects
- Share agents with team
- Create agent library
- Adapt existing agents to Context Mesh structure

### 6. Choose the Right Format
- **Simple format**: General-purpose, learning, small projects
- **Detailed format**: Specialized, production, strict boundaries, team collaboration

---

## Integration with Context Mesh

AI Agents **complement** Context Mesh, they don't replace it:

**Context Mesh provides**:
- Intent (what and why)
- Decisions (how and why)
- Knowledge (patterns, anti-patterns)
- Learnings (what we learned)

**AI Agents provide**:
- Execution patterns (how to execute)
- Modular workflows
- Reusable automation
- Team collaboration patterns

**Together**:
- Context Mesh = Foundation (what, why, how decided)
- AI Agents = Execution (how to execute)
- Result = Complete AI-First workflow

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature

**Without Agents** (basic Context Mesh):
```
1. Load: @context/intent/feature-auth.md
2. Load: @context/decisions/001-jwt.md
3. Prompt: "Generate authentication feature"
```

**With Agents**:
```
1. Load: @context/agents/agent-developer.md
2. Load: @context/intent/feature-auth.md
3. Load: @context/decisions/001-jwt.md
4. Prompt: "Execute Developer agent for authentication feature"
```

### Example 2: Complex Feature

**With Agents** (modular):
```
1. Load: @context/agents/agent-developer.md
2. Load: @context/intent/feature-checkout.md
3. Execute: "Generate API layer only"
4. Then: Load @context/agents/agent-reviewer.md
5. Execute: "Review API layer"
6. Then: Continue with UI layer...
```

## When Not to Use Agents

Don't use agents when:
- ❌ Your project is simple (basic Context Mesh is enough)
- ❌ You're just starting (keep it simple)
- ❌ You prefer ad-hoc execution
- ❌ Agents add more complexity than value

**Remember**: Agents are **optional extensions**. Use them when they add value, not because they exist.

- ✅ Provides execution patterns
- ✅ Start simple, add when needed
- ✅ Keep agents focused and documented

Start with basic Context Mesh, add agents when complexity grows.
