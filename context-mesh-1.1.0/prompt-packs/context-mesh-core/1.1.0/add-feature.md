# Prompt: Add Feature

Use this prompt to add a new feature to a project that already has Context Mesh.

**What is a feature?** A distinct piece of functionality (e.g., "user authentication", "payment processing", "dark mode"). Each feature gets:
- **Intent file** (`feature-*.md`) - Documents WHAT and WHY
- **Decision file** (`decisions/*.md`) - Documents HOW (technical approach, also called ADR)

## How to Use

1. **Copy** the prompt below
2. **Paste** in your AI assistant (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.)
3. **Answer** the questions
4. **Review** generated files
5. **Build** - Use the execution prompt to implement

## Prompt

```
Add a new feature to this Context Mesh project.

**FIRST: Load framework context:**
- Load @context/.context-mesh-framework.md (if exists) to understand Context Mesh framework rules and file type separation
- Understand Plan, Approve, Execute pattern
- Understand when to create vs not create files

Then, analyze the existing @context/ to check if this feature already exists:
- Check if feature-[name].md already exists in context/intent/
- If feature exists, inform me: "This feature already exists. Use update-feature.md to modify it, or choose a different name."
- If feature does NOT exist, proceed with the questions below.

Then ask me:

**Feature Information:**
1. Feature name
2. What it does and why we need it
3. Acceptance criteria

**Technical Decision (ADR):**
4. Technical approach - What technical solution will be used?
5. Why this approach? (Rationale) - What are the reasons for choosing this approach?
6. What alternatives did you consider? - What other options were evaluated and why weren't they chosen?
7. Technical context - Any constraints, existing patterns, or dependencies that influence this decision?

Then create:
- context/intent/feature-[name].md
  - Include "Related" section with bidirectional links:
    - [Project Intent](project-intent.md)
    - [Decision: [Feature Name]](../decisions/[next-number]-[name].md)
- context/decisions/[next-number]-[name].md (ADR required BEFORE implementing)
  - Include: Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives Considered, Related links, Status
  - Include "Related" section with bidirectional links:
    - [Project Intent](../intent/project-intent.md)
    - [Feature: [Feature Name]](../intent/feature-[name].md)
    - [Decision: Tech Stack](001-tech-stack.md) (if applicable and exists)
- Update context/intent/project-intent.md
  - Add new feature to "Related" section: [Feature: [Feature Name]](feature-[name].md)
- Update changelog.md
- Update AGENTS.md (Feature-Specific Context section)

Follow the pattern of existing files in @context/.
Remember: ADR must exist before implementation starts. The decision file should be complete with all sections.

**Important**: Create bidirectional links between feature and decision files:
- Feature files must link to their decision files using format: `- [Decision: Name](../decisions/[number]-[name].md)`
- Decision files must link back to their feature files using format: `- [Feature: Name](../intent/feature-[name].md)`
- Use markdown link format: `- [Type: Name](path/to/file.md)`
```

## Execute: Build the Feature

After files are created, use this prompt to implement:

```
Implement the feature following @context/intent/feature-[name].md 
and @context/decisions/[number]-[name].md

**MANDATORY: Follow Plan, Approve, Execute pattern:**

1. **PLAN** (Do this first - DO NOT SKIP):
   - Load @context/.context-mesh-framework.md (if exists) to understand framework rules
   - Load @context/intent/project-intent.md (always)
   - Load @context/intent/feature-[name].md
   - Load @context/decisions/[number]-[name].md
   - Load relevant patterns from @context/knowledge/patterns/ (if any)
   - Load relevant anti-patterns from @context/knowledge/anti-patterns/ (if any)
   - Analyze existing codebase structure
   - Verify ADR exists (decision file must exist before implementation)
   - Explain your implementation approach based on the decision
   - List ALL files you will create
   - List ALL files you will modify
   - Show code structure/architecture you will create
   - Explain how you'll follow the documented decision and patterns
   - Present the complete plan clearly

2. **APPROVE** (Wait for approval - DO NOT SKIP):
   - Ask explicitly: "Should I proceed with this implementation plan?"
   - DO NOT write any code until user approves
   - If user requests changes, update plan and ask again

3. **EXECUTE** (Only after approval):
   - Implement according to approved plan
   - Follow all context files strictly
   - Respect decisions from @context/decisions/
   - Use patterns from @context/knowledge/patterns/
   - Avoid anti-patterns from @context/knowledge/anti-patterns/
   - Create/modify only files from approved plan
```

## What This Prompt Does

- **Checks if feature exists** - Verifies if feature-[name].md already exists before creating
- **Creates feature intent** - Documents what and why
- **Creates complete decision (ADR)** - Documents technical approach with context, rationale, and alternatives (required before implementation)
- **Updates project-intent.md** - Adds new feature to "Related" section for traceability
- **Updates changelog** - Records the new feature
- **Updates AGENTS.md** - Keeps references current

**Important**: If the feature already exists, the prompt will inform you to use `update-feature.md` instead. This prevents duplicate features and preserves context.

**Decision Quality**: The prompt collects all necessary information to create a complete ADR with:
- Context (situation and requirements)
- Decision (technical approach details)
- Rationale (why this approach)
- Alternatives Considered (other options evaluated)
- Related links (bidirectional links to features, other decisions, etc.)

**Bidirectional Links**: The prompt creates proper links between feature and decision files:
- Feature intent files link to their decision files
- Decision files link back to their feature files
- Links use the format: `- [Type: Name](path/to/file.md)`

---

## Next Steps

- **Feature changed?** Use `update-feature.md`
- **Found a bug?** Use `fix-bug.md`
- **Done implementing?** AI updates context automatically (if AGENTS.md exists) or use `learn-update.md`
